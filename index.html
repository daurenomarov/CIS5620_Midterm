                                        <h3 class="post-subtitle">Good and evil are pretty well-defined in The Fellowship of the Ring. Here's the gist: Ring = evil; no Ring = good. The crazy thing about evil in this novel is that is has the power to turn everything else evil, too. Even the most well-intentioned characters can be turned to the dark side by the power of the Ring. Something worth fighting against, we'd say. And except for Tom Bombadil, it seems like every character is in fact involved in the battle between good and evil: this conflict is the driving force in Middle-earth, and in Tolkien's story.</h3>

                                    <h3 class="post-subtitle">The Two Towers presents a world in turmoil at the brink of war, and it begins with the dissolution of the Fellowship—a company of nine people created to take the Ring to Mordor and destroy it—partially due to Boromirs actions. The Ring exploits what is seemingly one of Boromirs most heroic and noble qualities—his desire to protect and preserve his homeland and its people. At the end of The Fellowship of the Ring, it drives him to try to take the Ring from Frodo, revealing his susceptibility to influence and the allure of power. This act does not, however, reveal him to be wholly evil, as Sauron, the Nazgûl, or the orcs have proven to be. His next and final act, heroically sacrificing his life in the defense of Merry and Pippin, is one of love and selflessness, completely opposed to his arrogant desire for the Ring. Boromirs tragic fate is the first indication of the newly complicated nature of morality in Middle-earth and proves the power of the Ring to corrupt even the most noble of men.</h3></a>

                                        <h3 class="post-subtitle">In the final movie of the trilogy Frodo struggles with the Ring on Mount Doom and present an interesting twist on the moral structure of Middle-earth. Frodo ultimately fails in his quest. But his intentions have remained pure throughout. And those intentions matter a great deal. In fact, they matter more than anything else. Thanks to Frodo's basic goodness, fate steps in and corrects Frodo's final failure. By contrast, Gollum is the one who actually destroys the Ring of Power. But he does so accidentally, so he dies unredeemed. Frodo does evil unintentionally, while trying to do good. Gollum does good unintentionally while trying to do evil. That makes all the difference in the world. Or at least in Middle-earth.</h3>
